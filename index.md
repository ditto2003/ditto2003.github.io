# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at McMaster University.

My research focuses on Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) using model-based or data-driven methodologies. State-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are exploited for FDD, including machine learning, deep learning and Transformer networks.



You can find my resume [<u>here</u>](/docs/CV_YuZhang.pdf).
